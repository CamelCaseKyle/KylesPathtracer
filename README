This is a very basic general forward solution for the rendering problem. 
It started life on Shadertoy so all the computation is done in the fragment shader (ouch!)
The goal is to get as many features as I can to naturally arise out of it.
For example, when I added the BTDF to regions of participating media I get SSS, Volume Caustics, etc
What's also cool is how easy it is to implement a metamaterial like a retro-reflector or a nonlinear material.
Recently it was upgraded to use Constructive Solid Geometry to represent shapes
