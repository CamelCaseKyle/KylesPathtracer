This is a very basic real-time forward path tracer with MIS and reprojection.
It started life on Shadertoy so all the computation is done in the fragment shader (ouch!)

TODO:
-probabilistic differentials over surface normal
-G buffer smoothing
-Volumetric reprojection (participating media)
-Bidirectional path tracing (participating media)

ChangeLog
-Dynamic temporal smoothing
-Better noise algorithm with parameterized R2
-Specular reprojection
-Diffuse reprojection
-Better noise algorithm with PCG
-Low Discrepency sampling with R2 sequence (naive)
-More physically realistic PDFs
-Implemented MIS (naive)
-Seperated geometric and probabilistic calculations
