This is a very basic real-time forward path tracer with MIS and reprojection.
It started life on Shadertoy so all the computation is done in the fragment shader (ouch!)
No view-dependant FX are implemented yet (reflections, specular lighting, etc)

TODO:
-Light reprojection (view-dependant FX)
-Volumetric reprojection (participating media)
-Bidirectional path tracing (participating media)
-G buffer smoothing

ChangeLog
-Implemented diffuse reprojection
-Better noise algorithm with PCG
-Non-random sampling with Weyl sequence
-More physically realistic PDFs
-Implemented MIS
-Seperated geometric and probabilistic calculations
